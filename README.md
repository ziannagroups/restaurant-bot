## 🚀 Quick Start (Free in 15 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your Free WhatsApp Sandbox (Twilio)

1. Go to [twilio.com](https://twilio.com) → Sign up free
2. Go to **Messaging → Try it out → Send a WhatsApp message**
3. Follow the instructions to join the sandbox (send a message from your phone)
4. Note your:
   - **Account SID** (starts with `AC`)
   - **Auth Token**
   - **Sandbox number** (usually `+14155238886`)

### Step 2: Set Up MongoDB (Free)

1. Go to [cloud.mongodb.com](https://cloud.mongodb.com) → Sign up free
2. Create a **free M0 cluster** (512MB, enough for thousands of orders)
3. Create a database user (username + password)
4. Click **Connect → Connect your application**
5. Copy the connection string (looks like `mongodb+srv://...`)

### Step 3: Deploy to Railway (Free)

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) → Sign up with GitHub
2. Click **New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo**
3. Push this code to a GitHub repo first, then connect it
4. In Railway, go to **Variables** tab and add all variables from `.env.example`
5. Railway auto-detects Node.js and deploys. You'll get a URL like:
   `https://your-app.railway.app`

### Step 4: Connect Twilio to Your Server

1. Go to Twilio Console → **Messaging → WhatsApp Sandbox Settings**
2. Set **"When a message comes in"** webhook to:
   ```
   https://your-app.railway.app/webhook
   ```
3. Method: `HTTP POST`
4. Save!

### Step 5: Test It!

Send `hello` to your Twilio sandbox number on WhatsApp.
The bot should reply instantly with the welcome message! 🎉

## 🔐 Going to Production (WhatsApp Business API)

When you're ready for a real business number:

1. Go to [business.facebook.com/whatsapp](https://business.facebook.com/whatsapp)
2. Apply for WhatsApp Business API
3. Verify your business (takes 2-7 days)
4. Get your own WhatsApp number
5. Update `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` in your `.env`
6. Upgrade your Twilio account for production sending

For interactive buttons & list messages (native WhatsApp UI), you'll also need to
create **message templates** in Meta Business Manager.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Bot not responding?**
- Check Twilio webhook URL is correct
- Check server logs on Railway
- Make sure MongoDB is connected (check logs)

**Messages not sending?**
- Verify Twilio credentials in `.env`
- Check you joined the sandbox (send the join code first)
- Sandbox sessions expire — customer must rejoin every 72 hours

**Database errors?**
- Make sure MongoDB connection string is correct
- Whitelist `0.0.0.0/0` in MongoDB Atlas Network Access
